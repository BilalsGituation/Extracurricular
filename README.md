# Extracurricular

(4th May 2022)
This repository contains projects outside my Bioinformatics course (until Sep 2022).
I do these projects in order to learn new things, revise what i've learned, to do
something interesting in my free time, and of course to show all of that off to
potential employers.

Thank you for checking out this repository and for any feedback you may give it!
